10. Which queue would you give to high scale, durable or not durable, and why?
11. 1 Deaspatcher for the queues is enough for high scale?
12. Which class would you implement RabbitMQ in .NET?
13. Explain how lock in C# / Node.js for high scale works.
14. How sync of threads works in .NET.
15. Give one design pattern you know in .NET.
16. What's the difference between concurrency and parallelism.
17. What are the benefits of Typescript?
