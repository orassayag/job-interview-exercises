/* 1. Write a function that detect if 2 strings ar anagram. Key notes:
   a. Suggest alternatives for the simplest way.
   b. What is the most efficient way of checking anagram you know?

   2. You have a function the gets an array of numbers.
   The function split the array into 2 parts, and randomly
   sort one side of the array and return it.
   -If it sort the left side, it will return 0.
   -If it sort the right side, it will return 1.
   -In any case it will always return 0 or 1, even if
   there is nothing to sort (and even if the array is
   already sorted).

   You need to find a way (without changing the function)
   to get a complete array to be sorted.
