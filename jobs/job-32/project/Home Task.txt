FS Challenge:

Your challenge is to create a BE service that handles scheduled email reports and simple FE to visualize it:

	• Data:
		• In DB you have list of Definitions for scheduled email reports. Each definition has:
			• Recipients list
			• Email body
			• Recurrence (for example: every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday at 14:00), granularity of 1 hour
			• Timezone
		• ℹ️ For simplicity, you can mock DB with local in-memory/file storage, yet consider data schema, performance and indexes. Also feel free to adjust the Definition object for your needs.
	• BE:
		• Your service should get relevant Definitions to treat at a given time
		• For simplicity and to avoid creating a scheduler, provide only an API that gets a timeframe as parameter and as result does the following:
			• Gets all relevant Definitions relevant to the given timeframe (default is ’now’)
			• ‘treat' them by writes to log
			• Mark them as ’treated’ with treatment timestamp
		• ℹ️ Assume there are millions of Definitions scheduled to be treated at same time, and there's no limitation on size of email body
	• FE:
		• Create a simple FE app to:
			• Visualize the list of definitions
			• Generate bulk of random definitions and trigger treatment
			• Visualize treatment (which definitions were treated, how many left, etc.)
			• Keep best practices for React apps
	• Bonus:
		• TypeScript
		• Tests

We suggest to top the efforts up to 3h max.
Please let me know when we can schedule a review meeting to go over your submission, make sure to have 24h window after your submission to the date you provide so we could evaluate it beforehand.
